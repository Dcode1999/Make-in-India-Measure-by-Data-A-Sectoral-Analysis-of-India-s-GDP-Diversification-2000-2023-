## 📁 Dataset
Sector-wise contribution to GDP (%), years 2000–2023  
Sectors: Agriculture, Manufacturing, Industry, Services

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn)

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Created binary classification target: `Services Dominated` vs `Diversified`
2. Visualized sectoral trends and economic dominance
3. Trained Logistic Regression model (Accuracy: 100% on test set)
4. Forecasted sector contributions for 2024–2030 using Linear Regression
5. Classified future years using the trained model

## 📈 Key Results
- Services continue to dominate GDP through 2030 (~51%)
- Manufacturing & Industry show flat growth
- Agriculture declines steadily
- No major structural shift observed despite national initiatives

---

## 📌 Real-World Relevance
- Model aligns with RBI, IMF projections for 2024–25
